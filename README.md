# 🔍 Job Finder API

 A FastAPI-based intelligent job scraping and matching API that aggregates listings from LinkedIn, Indeed, and one additional job portal. 
 It processes job search criteria using LLMs to return only the most relevant listings, structured and ready for consumption.

 ## 📌 Overview

 This project serves as a **Machine Learning Engineer Assessment** and demonstrates your ability to:

 - Build robust APIs with FastAPI.
 - Integrate web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup/Selenium/Scrapy).
 - Fetch jobs from online platforms: **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, and a third source **Google Jobs**
 - Use **LLMs (OpenAI/HuggingFace)** to analyze and rank job descriptions based on user-defined relevance.

 ## 💡 LLM Integration

 - Supports OpenAI GPT or HuggingFace transformers  
 - Relevant job descriptions are selected based on semantic similarity to user criteria  

 ---

 ## 🧪 Sample Testing

 Use a REST client like Postman or `curl`:
 ```bash
 curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/search_jobs \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "position": "Full Stack Engineer",
            "experience": "2 years",
            "salary": "70,000 PKR to 120,000 PKR",
            "jobNature": "onsite",
            "location": "Peshawar, Pakistan",
            "skills": "full stack, MERN"
          }'
 ```

 ## 📌 Notes

 - Ensure you have access to LLM API keys and job portals (if needed).  
 - Use headless browsing for JS-heavy portals.  
 - Logging & error handling included.

 ## ✨ Future Enhancements

 - Dockerize the project for easy deployment  
 - Add frontend for visualization  
 - Enable user authentication and job alerts
